Rust Arcade Shooter
====================
By Ashton Hunger

About
------
Rust Arcade Shooter is a very basic toy game, written to try game development in Rust. Currently, the game is a combination of various space shooter games found in an arcade. The game itself is an endless set of waves which you need to kill, and usually becomes impossible in after wave 6. The systems the game is built around could be extensible to more in depth gameplay though. (I may put time to it, I've enjoyed the work so far).
